Homemade Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins

Ingredients
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup melted unsalted butter
3/4 cup brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 tablespoon vanilla
3/4 cup mashed bananas
1/4 cup milk
1 cup chocolate chips

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Line a muffin tin with muffin papers. You'll end up with 12-14 muffins total. 
2. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. 
3. In a second large bowl whisk together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Then gently fold in the mashed bananas. 
4. Gently fold about 1/2 of the flour mixture into the wet ingredients, followed by about 1/2 of the milk. Repeat with the rest of the flour mixture and milk. Be careful not to over mix. 
5. Gently fold the chocolate chips into the batter. 
6. Spoon the muffin batter into your prepared muffin pan until each cavity is filled to the top. Optionally, sprinkle a few chocolate chips on top of each muffin. 
7. Bake for 16-20 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean (except for melted chocolate).
8. Allow to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan, then remove from the pan and continue cooling on a wire rack for 5-10 minutes before eating.
